# Flower

This is my Unity Project for helping me breed flowers on Animal Crossing. It uses Bayes Theorem to try and determine the genetic code of flowers. This is helpful, as different flowers of the same colour might have different genes. From breeding flowers and seeing the offspring, my tool finds the probabilities of flowes having certain genetic codes.

The mathematics for this will appear on here soon!
